# T-Bot Rewritten Python Server

This repository contains the source code for the **T-Bot Rewritten Python server**.

Open sourced for everyone to use. I'm not coming back to the scene.

This repository does not and will not contain any website logic. I'm not willing to share that portion as that is out of the scope of the project and portions of said code are still being used for my current projects.

A default account with username and password `icseon` is already available.

## Game Client Compatibility

*Note: The code is somewhat old, but it has received constant improvements. A recent addition is the `@autosell` command, which, when activated inside a sector, automatically sells item boxes according to the prices defined in the database.*
